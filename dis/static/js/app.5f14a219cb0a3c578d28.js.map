To house and exhibit this precious gift, to show Mr. Han’s love of the country and Chinese culture, and to disseminate his aesthetic ideas, the local government built an art gallery in the Liyuan Cultural Theme Park. Two years later, a Palace in Art—Beijing Han Meilin Art Gallery opened to the public on June 25, 2008. It covers an area of nearly 10,000 square meters, combining the ideals of man and nature and integrating Eastern and Western architectural aesthetics. Quiet, spacious and bright, it interweaves time and space and displays unique architectural excellence, further adding cultural significance to the human landscape of the capital city of Beijing. It also shines in concert with the Hangzhou Han Meilin Art Gallery (opened October 19, 2005) located at the other end of the ancient Great Canal. Blending the historic and the modern, this cultural pattern highlights the attraction of the ancient canal’s history and culture. Mr. Han Meilin, whose father comes from Shandong in northern China and whose mother was born in Zhejiang in southern China, is a patriotic artist with a strong sense of belonging and gratitude to China.</p><p>In addition to the Introductory Hall, Arts and Crafts Hall, Paperboard Ornamental Hall, Sculpture Hall, Chinese Calligraphy and Traditional Painting Hall, Newly-Created Works Hall, Video Hall, and Sculpture-Making Studio, there is the Seal-Book Building, and the Pottery Bar. Such cultural facilities provide visitors with an interactive cultural platform where they can enjoy the beauty of art in genetral as well as that of Chinese civilization.</p><p>Beijing Han Meilin Art Gallery was designed by the famous Chinese architect Kai Cui. His design concept is that the art gallery’s site and form have an important impact on Liyuan Park’s space as an integral part of the Cultural Theme Park. If we take the whole park as a natural landscape painting, the art gallery serves as a traditional Chinese seal affixed just when the painting is finished. The relation between the seal and the painting corresponds to that of the art gallery and the park. They are indispensible to and complementary to each other. Considering that Chinese calligraphy and seal cutting are also an aspect of Mr. Han’s artistic creation, the designer chose the Chinese character for “beauty” (美 mei) as the graphic design prototype of the art gallery. Looking down from above, the shape of the entire art gallery is like a “美” ; thus the strokes of the Chinese calligraphic character represent  the architecture’s functional space. Significantly, the word “beauty” (美 mei) is also second word of Han Meilin’s name which can also be understood as representing aesthetics and artistic beauty. These explanations are of the realistic and of the abstract as well.</p><p>Our art gallery adheres to the “people-oriented development philosophy”, and the staff makes great efforts to provide the public with the most professional, most people-oriented services. In keeping with Mr. Han Meilin’s noble sentiments, art philosophy and purpose for founding the art gallery, guests have enjoyed free admission to the art gallery since opening day. We will be glad to see more art lovers come to visit this palace of art. Here, visitors can appreciate countless wonderful works of art created by Han Meilin with his open-heated, forthright and sincere love, deep emotion and magic whiteboard marker pens and brushes, all of which most ordinary people can’t imagine. Visitors can also experience a great artist’s life and better understand a versatile artist who has achieved extraordinary success in almost all artistic aspects. Mr. Han is like an active volcano which is incessantly erupting with artistic lava – the flower never ceases. As Mr. Han has said, “I just work hard on my art throughout my life, not for money, scholarly honors or official rank. It is God’s way of telling me that since I’m as stubborn as an ox, I’ll have to work as hard as one.”</p>'\n};\n\n/* harmony default export */ __webpack_exports__[\"default\"] = ({\n\tdata: function

To house and exhibit this precious gift, to show Mr. Han’s love of the country and Chinese culture, and to disseminate his aesthetic ideas, the local government built an art gallery in the Liyuan Cultural Theme Park. Two years later, a Palace in Art—Beijing Han Meilin Art Gallery opened to the public on June 25, 2008. It covers an area of nearly 10,000 square meters, combining the ideals of man and nature and integrating Eastern and Western architectural aesthetics. Quiet, spacious and bright, it interweaves time and space and displays unique architectural excellence, further adding cultural significance to the human landscape of the capital city of Beijing. It also shines in concert with the Hangzhou Han Meilin Art Gallery (opened October 19, 2005) located at the other end of the ancient Great Canal. Blending the historic and the modern, this cultural pattern highlights the attraction of the ancient canal’s history and culture. Mr. Han Meilin, whose father comes from Shandong in northern China and whose mother was born in Zhejiang in southern China, is a patriotic artist with a strong sense of belonging and gratitude to China.</p><p>In addition to the Introductory Hall, Arts and Crafts Hall, Paperboard Ornamental Hall, Sculpture Hall, Chinese Calligraphy and Traditional Painting Hall, Newly-Created Works Hall, Video Hall, and Sculpture-Making Studio, there is the Seal-Book Building, and the Pottery Bar. Such cultural facilities provide visitors with an interactive cultural platform where they can enjoy the beauty of art in genetral as well as that of Chinese civilization.</p><p>Beijing Han Meilin Art Gallery was designed by the famous Chinese architect Kai Cui. His design concept is that the art gallery’s site and form have an important impact on Liyuan Park’s space as an integral part of the Cultural Theme Park. If we take the whole park as a natural landscape painting, the art gallery serves as a traditional Chinese seal affixed just when the painting is finished. The relation between the seal and the painting corresponds to that of the art gallery and the park. They are indispensible to and complementary to each other. Considering that Chinese calligraphy and seal cutting are also an aspect of Mr. Han’s artistic creation, the designer chose the Chinese character for “beauty” (美 mei) as the graphic design prototype of the art gallery. Looking down from above, the shape of the entire art gallery is like a “美” ; thus the strokes of the Chinese calligraphic character represent  the architecture’s functional space. Significantly, the word “beauty” (美 mei) is also second word of Han Meilin’s name which can also be understood as representing aesthetics and artistic beauty. These explanations are of the realistic and of the abstract as well.</p><p>Our art gallery adheres to the “people-oriented development philosophy”, and the staff makes great efforts to provide the public with the most professional, most people-oriented services. In keeping with Mr. Han Meilin’s noble sentiments, art philosophy and purpose for founding the art gallery, guests have enjoyed free admission to the art gallery since opening day. We will be glad to see more art lovers come to visit this palace of art. Here, visitors can appreciate countless wonderful works of art created by Han Meilin with his open-heated, forthright and sincere love, deep emotion and magic whiteboard marker pens and brushes, all of which most ordinary people can’t imagine. Visitors can also experience a great artist’s life and better understand a versatile artist who has achieved extraordinary success in almost all artistic aspects. Mr. Han is like an active volcano which is incessantly erupting with artistic lava – the flower never ceases. As Mr. Han has said, “I just work hard on my art throughout my life, not for money, scholarly honors or official rank. It is God’s way of telling me that since I’m as stubborn as an ox, I’ll have to work as hard as one.”</p>'\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n\texport default {\r\n\t\tdata() {\r\n\t\t\treturn {\r\n\t\t\t\tbannerBj:
